# kinetic-editable-text
##### A KineticJS library which enables text creation and editing directly on the canvas

## Summary

Re-inventing the wheel in text editing!

This tool was created in order to avoid the HTML textarea popup when wanting to enter text on the canvas. Most operations are supported, such as cursor movement, backspace, delete, and entering new lines.

Selecting text is not yet supported.

## Developing

This project use bower to control dependencies and grunt to make a build.

To run the project for the first time, run in project root folder:

    $ npm install

To make a build use:

    $ grunt publish 

This command will generate the build in /dist folder.


## Initialization

#### Without a module loader
The global ```Kinetic``` object will be extended with ```Kinetic.EditableText```

#### With CommonJS or AMD
kinetic-editable-text will return an object containing an ```init``` method. ```Kinetic``` is passed as the first argument to the ```init``` method, and will be extended with ```Kinetic.EditableText```. An AMD example:

    define([ 'Kinetic', 'kineticEditableText' ], function( Kinetic, kineticEditableText ){
        console.log( typeof Kinetic.EditableText ); // undefined
    
        kineticEditableText.init( Kinetic );
    
        console.log( typeof Kinetic.EditableText ); // function
    });

## API

#### Kinetic.EditableText.focus()

Focus the ```Kinetic.EditableText``` field so that it will start receiving text input.

#### Kinetic.EditableText.unfocus()

Unfocus the ```Kinetic.EditableText``` field so that it will stop receiving text input.

#### Kinetic.EditableText.addChar( ```character``` )

Add the specified ```character``` (string) to the ```Kinetic.EditableText``` field at the current cursor position. 

#### Kinetic.EditableText.text( ```string``` )

This method mimics ```Kinetic.Text.text```. If ```string``` is provided, the text in the ```Kinetic.EditableText``` field will be set to ```string```; otherwise, the text currently in the field will be returned.

#### Kinetic.EditableText.backspaceChar()

Remove the character to the left of the current cursor position.

#### Kinetic.EditableText.deleteChar()

Remove the character to the right of the current cursor position.

#### Kinetic.EditableText.clear()

Remove all of the characters from the ```Kinetic.EditableText``` field.
